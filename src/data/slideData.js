• Often gives loose upper bounds

AMORTIZED WAY:
• Sum amortized costs (carefully chosen values)

2. Amortized cost is 2:
   • Total cost / number of operations = 2n/n = 2

MAIN LIMITATION:
The method isn't very useful in practice because:

THE CIRCULAR PROBLEM:
• Our objective: Use amortized complexity to get better bounds

• n-bit binary counter
• Cost of incrementing = number of bits that change
• Example: 001011 → 001100 has cost 3 (3 bits flip)
• Counter starts at 0
• Question: What is the cost of incrementing the counter m times (where m ≤ 2^n - 1)?

This is a fundamental problem that demonstrates how amortized analysis can provide much tighter bounds than worst-case analysis for sequences of operations.`,

Applying worst-case analysis to the binary counter.

WORST-CASE ANALYSIS:
• Worst-case cost of a single increment is n
• Example: 011111 → 100000 costs 6 (all 6 bits change)
• This could theoretically happen on any increment

TOTAL COST BOUND:
• m increments, each potentially costing n
• Total cost ≤ m × n

This gives us an upper bound of O(mn) for m increments. But this analysis is overly pessimistic - the worst case (all bits flipping) happens rarely. Most increments change only a few bits.`,

The counter starts at 00000, and we track how often each bit position changes during m increments.

Applying the Accounting Method to the binary counter problem.

GUESS AND STRATEGY:
• Guess amortized cost = 2 per increment
• Need to show P(m) - P(0) ≥ 0 for all m

FIRST INCREMENT:
• One unit pays for changing bit 0: 0→1
• One unit remains as credit on bit 0
• This credit will pay when bit 0 changes 1→0 later

The diagram shows:
• Initial: 00000 with no credits

Since the number of 1s in any binary number is non-negative, our accounting scheme is valid. We've successfully shown that with amortized cost of 2 per increment, we maintain P(m) - P(0) ≥ 0 for all m.

PROBLEM SETUP:
• k-way tree (k > 1)
• Initial number of runs: r
• Add q ≥ 0 runs of length 0
• Each merge reduces runs by (k-1)

EQUATION:
• After s merges: r + q - s(k-1) runs
• Must reach exactly 1 run
• Therefore: r + q - s(k-1) = 1
• Need to find minimum q

This determines how many dummy runs to add.`

MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION:
• From r + q - s(k-1) = 1
• Rearrange: r + q - 1 = s(k-1)
• Therefore: (r + q - 1) mod (k-1) = 0
• This means q < k-1

FINAL FORMULA:
• If (r-1) mod (k-1) = 0: q = 0
• Otherwise: q = k-1 - (r-1) mod (k-1)
• Simplifies to: q = (1-r) mod (k-1)

EXAMPLE 2: k = 4, r = 6

NET EFFECT:

    explanation: `LEFTIST TREES - PROPERTY 2

Second fundamental property of leftist trees.

PROPERTY 2:
The number of internal nodes is at least 2^s(root) - 1

REASONING:
• Levels 1 through s(root) have no external nodes
• These levels must be completely filled with internal nodes
• Minimum occurs when tree is "minimal leftist tree"

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
• Level i has at least 2^(i-1) internal nodes
• Summing levels 1 to s(root):
• Total ≥ 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(s(root)-1)
• Total ≥ 2^s(root) - 1

IMPORTANCE:
• Provides lower bound on tree size
• Relates s(root) to number of nodes
• Foundation for Property 3

IMPLICATIONS:
• Leftist trees cannot be arbitrarily sparse
• Guarantees reasonable node distribution
• Enables complexity analysis

Property 2 provides minimum node count guarantee.`

Visual demonstration of Property 2.

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS:
• Leftist tree with s(root) = 2
• Levels 1 and 2 have no external nodes
• These levels must contain internal nodes

LEVEL ANALYSIS:
• Level 1: root node (1 internal node)
• Level 2: at least some internal nodes
• External nodes only appear at level 3 or beyond

VERIFICATION:
• s(root) = 2
• Minimum internal nodes = 2^2 - 1 = 3
• Tree must have at least 3 internal nodes

QUESTION POSED:
• What is maximum number of internal nodes?
• Depends on specific tree structure
• But minimum is guaranteed by Property 2

SIGNIFICANCE:
• Demonstrates node distribution constraint
• Shows relationship between s() and tree size
• Foundation for complexity analysis

Levels 1 through s(root) contain only internal nodes.`

    explanation: `LEFTIST TREES - PROPERTY 3

Third fundamental property establishing complexity.

PROPERTY 3:
Length of rightmost path is O(log n), where n is the number of internal nodes in a leftist tree.

PROOF:
From Property 2: n ≥ 2^s(root) - 1
Therefore: s(root) ≤ log₂(n + 1)
From Property 1: length of rightmost path = s(root)

CONCLUSION:
• Rightmost path length ≤ log₂(n + 1)
• Therefore: rightmost path length = O(log n)

SIGNIFICANCE:
• Guarantees logarithmic operation complexity
• Operations traversing right spine are efficient
• Foundation for meld, insert, remove complexity

APPLICATIONS:
• All major leftist tree operations
• Meld operation efficiency
• Priority queue performance

IMPORTANCE:
• Establishes theoretical foundation
• Guarantees practical efficiency
• Enables competitive performance with heaps
